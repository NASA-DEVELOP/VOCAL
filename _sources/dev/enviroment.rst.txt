Development Enviroment
======================

VOCAL hosts support for a couple different IDE's, but there is really no *mandatory* development enviroment required. Here are a couple recommendations based on your platform 32-bit is a **must** for now, as much as we wish 64-bit would work out there are some dependencies we just can't get rid of. 


.. rubric:: Window

* PyCharm

  PyCharm is also a super powerful IDE for developing, and the plus here is it offers
  tools that ensure you follow the correct programming practices as outlined in the Coding
  Conventions.

* Eclipse

  Eclipse is great IDE that offers some powerful tools, the VOCAL repository comes with a project
  file that allows for developers to easily load the project. See
  :doc:`The Installation Page </installation>` for steps on setting up Eclipse with VOCAL.

.. rubric:: Linux

* Console + VIM

  If you're a console loving guy, nothing is wrong with developing VOCAL using just the command line and the text editor of your choice (which should be VIM, right?)

* PyCharm

  *Highly* recommended, very easy to setup e.g. start the program and it's all set up. As mentioned above great to ensuring you follow the coding conventions as listed above.
